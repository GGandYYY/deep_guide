Give it a title and start typing like you would in any other document.  ## Headings   You can add headings and subheadings in one of two ways:  - Type `/heading` or `/h1`, `/h2`, or `/h3` to choose the heading size you want. - Use Markdown shortcuts, like `#`, `##`, and `###`. - Create inline code by wrapping text with ``` (or with the shortcut `cmd/ctrl + e`). - Create inline code by wrapping text with ``` (or with the shortcut `cmd/ctrl + e`).  ## Toggle Lists   - Click the arrow again to hide this content. - Create a toggle by typing `/toggle` and pressing `enter`. - You can add anything to toggles, including images and embeds.  ## Callout Blocks   ## Code Blocks   You can add code notation to any Notion page:  - Type `/code` and press `enter`. - Choose the language from the dropdown in the bottom right corner. - Here's an example: - Type `/code` and press `enter`. - Choose the language from the dropdown in the bottom right corner. - Here's an example:  ```html Hover over this block to see the <b>Copy to Clipboard</b> option! ```  - Your teammates can select any code to comment on it.  ## Organizing Pages   Instead of using folders, Notion lets you nest pages inside pages.
